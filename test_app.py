# Placeholder for UI tests
# UI testing for Tkinter can be done using libraries like `unittest.mock` or by structuring the application
# to separate UI logic from business logic, making the latter independently testable.

# For example, one might test:
# - If button click actions trigger the correct underlying functions (using mocks).
# - If data processing logic (if any, separated from UI) behaves as expected.

pass # Indicates an intentionally empty block, satisfying Python's syntax for an empty file/module.
