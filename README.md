# Call Center Agent Application

This is a Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter, designed as a conceptual model for a call center agent dashboard.

## Features

- **Main Window Layout:**
    - A top bar containing an agent status dropdown.
    - A left navigation panel with main action buttons.
    - A central content area for other interactions or information.

- **Agent Status Dropdown (Top-Right):**
    - Allows agents to select their current status.
    - Options: "Select Status", "Break - Lunch", "Break - Tea Time", "Break - Bathroom".
    - Selecting an option prints the new status to the console.

- **Navigation Buttons (Left Panel):**
    - **Contacts:** Placeholder for accessing contact information.
    - **Tasks:** Placeholder for managing agent tasks.
    - **Campaign Progress:** Placeholder for viewing campaign details.
    - Clicking these buttons prints a message to the console.

- **Original Buttons (Main Content Area):**
    - **Agent Login:** Placeholder for agent login functionality.
    - **Admin Login:** Placeholder for admin login functionality.
    - **Settings:** Placeholder for application settings.
    - Clicking these buttons also prints a message to the console.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (Tkinter is usually included with standard Python installations)

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Clone this repository or download the files.
3.  Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.
4.  Run the application from your terminal using the command:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    Or, if you are on a system where `python` refers to Python 2, you might need:

    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```

## Files

- `app.py`: Contains the source code for the Tkinter application, including UI layout and button/dropdown definitions.
- `test_app.py`: Placeholder for future UI and logic tests.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.
