# Simple UI Application

This is a simple Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Tkinter. It displays a window with three buttons: "Agent Login", "Admin Login", and "Settings".

## Features

- Main window with three buttons.
- Clicking a button prints a message to the console indicating which button was pressed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (Tkinter is usually included with standard Python installations)

## How to Run

1.  Ensure you have Python 3 installed.
2.  Clone this repository or download the files.
3.  Navigate to the directory containing `app.py`.
4.  Run the application from your terminal using the command:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    Or, if you are on a system where `python` refers to Python 2, you might need:

    ```bash
    python3 app.py
    ```

## Files

- `app.py`: Contains the source code for the Tkinter application.
- `test_app.py`: Placeholder for future UI tests.
